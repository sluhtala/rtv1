raytracer version 1. My first ray tracer. Written in c.
![demo1](/images/all_objects3.jpg)


The purpose of this project was to learn how the fundamentals of raytracing works. 
I use minilibx-library which is a hugely simplified x-window library provided by our school.
It is tested to work only on MacOS Catalina.

It only supports 5 scenes that are hardcoded in to program in order to demonstrate the basics shapes and lights.
Additional features involves saving .ppm file from image, capped cylinders and lots of matrix calculation.

After this project I was involved in another RT project that adds much more features to render more realistic images.
